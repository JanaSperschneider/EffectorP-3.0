### EffectorP-3.0: Prediction of apoplastic and cytoplasmic effectors in fungi and oomycetes

#### What is EffectorP 3.0?

Many fungi and oomycetes species are devasting plant pathogens and secrete effector proteins to facilitate plant infection. Fungi and oomycete pathogens have diverse infection strategies and their effectors do not share sequence homology. However, effectors still have unifying properties: they either localize extracellularly to the plant apoplast or intracellularly to the plant cytoplasm. EffectorP 3.0 exploits this biological signal and uses two machine learning models trained on apoplastic and cytoplasmic effectors, respectively.

For a given set of secreted pathogen proteins, EffectorP 3.0 will predict if a protein is:
* an apoplastic effector
* a cytoplasmic effector
* a dual-localized apoplastic/cytoplasmic effector
* a non-effector
